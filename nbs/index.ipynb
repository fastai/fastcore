    "Python is a powerful, dynamic language. Rather than bake everything into the language, it lets the programmer customize it to make it work for them. `fastcore` uses this flexibility to add to Python features inspired by other languages we've loved, like multiple dispatch from Julia, mixins from Ruby, and currying, binding, and more from Haskell. It also adds some \"missing features\" and clean up some rough edges in the Python standard library, such as simplifying parallel processing, and bringing ideas from NumPy over to Python's `list` type."
