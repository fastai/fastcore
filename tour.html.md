# A tour of fastcore


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

Here’s a (somewhat) quick tour of a few higlights from fastcore.

### Documentation

All fast.ai projects, including this one, are built with
[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai), which is a full literate programming
environment built on Jupyter Notebooks. That means that every piece of
documentation, including the page you’re reading now, can be accessed as
interactive Jupyter notebooks. In fact, you can even grab a link
directly to a notebook running interactively on Google Colab - if you
want to follow along with this tour, click the link below:

``` python
colab_link('index')
```

[Open `index` in
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/fastai/fastcore/blob/master/nbs/index.ipynb)

The full docs are available at
[fastcore.fast.ai](https://fastcore.fast.ai). The code in the examples
and in all fast.ai libraries follow the [fast.ai style
guide](https://docs.fast.ai/dev/style.html). In order to support
interactive programming, all fast.ai libraries are designed to allow for
`import *` to be used safely, particular by ensuring that
[`__all__`](https://riptutorial.com/python/example/2894/the---all---special-variable)
is defined in all packages. In order to see where a function is from,
just type it:

``` python
coll_repr
```

    <function fastcore.foundation.coll_repr(c, max_n=10)>

For more details, including a link to the full documentation and source
code, use `doc`, which pops up a window with this information:

``` python
doc(coll_repr)
```

<img src="images/att_00000.png" width="499" />

The documentation also contains links to any related functions or
classes, which appear like this:
[`coll_repr`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#coll_repr) (in
the notebook itself you will just see a word with back-ticks around it;
the links are auto-generated in the documentation site). The
documentation will generally show one or more examples of use, along
with any background context necessary to understand them. As you’ll see,
the examples for each function and method are shown as tests, rather
than example outputs, so let’s start by explaining that.

### Testing

fastcore’s testing module is designed to work well with
[nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai), which is a full literate programming
environment built on Jupyter Notebooks. That means that your tests,
docs, and code all live together in the same notebook. fastcore and
nbdev’s approach to testing starts with the premise that all your tests
should pass. If one fails, no more tests in a notebook are run.

Tests look like this:

``` python
test_eq(coll_repr(range(1000), 5), '(#1000) [0,1,2,3,4...]')
```

That’s an example from the docs for
[`coll_repr`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#coll_repr). As
you see, it’s not showing you the output directly. Here’s what that
would look like:

``` python
coll_repr(range(1000), 5)
```

    '(#1000) [0,1,2,3,4...]'

So, the test is actually showing you what the output looks like, because
if the function call didn’t return `'(#1000) [0,1,2,3,4...]'`, then the
test would have failed.

So every test shown in the docs is also showing you the behavior of the
library — and vice versa!

Test functions always start with `test_`, and then follow with the
operation being tested. So
[`test_eq`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/test.html#test_eq) tests for
equality (as you saw in the example above). This includes tests for
equality of arrays and tensors, lists and generators, and many more:

``` python
test_eq([0,1,2,3], np.arange(4))
```

When a test fails, it prints out information about what was expected:

``` python
test_eq([0,1,2,3], np.arange(3))
```

    ----
      AssertionError: ==:
      [0, 1, 2, 3]
      [0 1 2]

If you want to check that objects are the same type, rather than the
just contain the same collection, use
[`test_eq_type`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/test.html#test_eq_type).

You can test with any comparison function using
[`test`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/test.html#test), e.g test whether an
object is less than:

``` python
test(2, 3, operator.lt)
```

You can even test that exceptions are raised:

``` python
def divide_zero(): return 1/0
test_fail(divide_zero)
```

…and test that things are printed to stdout:

``` python
test_stdout(lambda: print('hi'), 'hi')
```

### Foundations

fast.ai is unusual in that we often use
[mixins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixin) in our code. Mixins are
widely used in many programming languages, such as Ruby, but not so much
in Python. We use mixins to attach new behavior to existing libraries,
or to allow modules to add new behavior to our own classes, such as in
extension modules. One useful example of a mixin we define is
[`Path.ls`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/xtras.html#path.ls), which lists a
directory and returns an
[`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l) (an extended list
class which we’ll discuss shortly):

``` python
p = Path('images')
p.ls()
```

    (#6) [Path('images/mnist3.png'),Path('images/att_00000.png'),Path('images/puppy.jpg'),Path('images/att_00005.png'),Path('images/att_00007.png'),Path('images/att_00006.png')]

You can easily add you own mixins with the
[`patch`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#patch)
[decorator](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/), which
takes advantage of Python 3 [function
annotations](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3107/#parameters) to
say what class to patch:

``` python
@patch
def num_items(self:Path): return len(self.ls())

p.num_items()
```

    6

We also use `**kwargs` frequently. In python `**kwargs` in a parameter
like means “*put any additional keyword arguments into a dict called
`kwargs`*”. Normally, using `kwargs` makes an API quite difficult to
work with, because it breaks things like tab-completion and popup lists
of signatures. `utils` provides
[`use_kwargs`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#use_kwargs) and
[`delegates`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#delegates) to avoid
this problem. See our [detailed article on
delegation](https://www.fast.ai/2019/08/06/delegation/) on this topic.

[`GetAttr`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#getattr) solves a
similar problem (and is also discussed in the article linked above):
it’s allows you to use Python’s exceptionally useful
[`__getattr__`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/xml.html#__getattr__) magic
method, but avoids the problem that normally in Python tab-completion
and docs break when using this. For instance, you can see here that
Python’s `dir` function, which is used to find the attributes of a
python object, finds everything inside the `self.default` attribute
here:

``` python
class Author:
    def __init__(self, name): self.name = name

class ProductPage(GetAttr):
    _default = 'author'
    def __init__(self,author,price,cost): self.author,self.price,self.cost = author,price,cost

p = ProductPage(Author("Jeremy"), 1.50, 0.50)
[o for o in dir(p) if not o.startswith('_')]
```

    ['author', 'cost', 'name', 'price']

Looking at that `ProductPage` example, it’s rather verbose and
duplicates a lot of attribute names, which can lead to bugs later if you
change them only in one place. `fastcore` provides
[`store_attr`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#store_attr) to
simplify this common pattern. It also provides
[`basic_repr`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#basic_repr) to give
simple objects a useful `repr`:

``` python
class ProductPage:
    def __init__(self,author,price,cost): store_attr()
    __repr__ = basic_repr('author,price,cost')

ProductPage("Jeremy", 1.50, 0.50)
```

    __main__.ProductPage(author='Jeremy', price=1.5, cost=0.5)

One of the most interesting `fastcore` functions is the
[`funcs_kwargs`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#funcs_kwargs)
decorator. This allows class behavior to be modified without
sub-classing. This can allow folks that aren’t familiar with
object-oriented programming to customize your class more easily. Here’s
an example of a class that uses
[`funcs_kwargs`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#funcs_kwargs):

``` python
@funcs_kwargs
class T:
    _methods=['some_method']
    def __init__(self, **kwargs): assert not kwargs, f'Passed unknown args: {kwargs}'

p = T(some_method = print)
p.some_method("hello")
```

    hello

The `assert not kwargs` above is used to ensure that the user doesn’t
pass an unknown parameter (i.e one that’s not in `_methods`). `fastai`
uses [`funcs_kwargs`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#funcs_kwargs)
in many places, for instance, you can customize any part of a
`DataLoader` by passing your own methods.

`fastcore` also provides many utility functions that make a Python
programmer’s life easier, in `fastcore.utils`. We won’t look at many
here, since you can easily look at the docs yourself. To get you
started, have a look at the docs for
[`chunked`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/basics.html#chunked) (remember, if
you’re in a notebook, type `doc(chunked)`), which is a handy function
for creating lazily generated batches from a collection.

Python’s
[`ProcessPoolExecutor`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/parallel.html#processpoolexecutor)
is extended to allow `max_workers` to be set to `0`, to easily turn off
parallel processing. This makes it easy to debug your code in serial,
then run it in parallel. It also allows you to pass arguments to your
parallel function, and to ensure there’s a pause between calls, in case
the process you are running has race conditions.
[`parallel`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/parallel.html#parallel) makes
parallel processing even easier to use, and even adds an optional
progress bar.

### L

Like most languages, Python allows for very concise syntax for some very
common types, such as `list`, which can be constructed with `[1,2,3]`.
Perl’s designer Larry Wall explained the reasoning for this kind of
syntax:

> In metaphorical honor of Huffman’s compression code that assigns
> smaller numbers of bits to more common bytes. In terms of syntax, it
> simply means that commonly used things should be shorter, but you
> shouldn’t waste short sequences on less common constructs.

On this basis, `fastcore` has just one type that has a single letter
name: [`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l). The reason for
this is that it is designed to be a replacement for `list`, so we want
it to be just as easy to use as `[1,2,3]`. Here’s how to create that as
an [`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l):

``` python
L(1,2,3)
```

    (#3) [1,2,3]

The first thing to notice is that an
[`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l) object includes in its
representation its number of elements; that’s the `(#3)` in the output
above. If there’s more than 10 elements, it will automatically truncate
the list:

``` python
p = L.range(20).shuffle()
p
```

    (#20) [5,1,9,10,18,13,6,17,3,16...]

[`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l) contains many of the
same indexing ideas that NumPy’s `array` does, including indexing with a
list of indexes, or a boolean mask list:

``` python
p[2,4,6]
```

    (#3) [9,18,6]

It also contains other methods used in `array`, such as
[`L.argwhere`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l.argwhere):

``` python
p.argwhere(ge(15))
```

    (#5) [4,7,9,18,19]

As you can see from this example, `fastcore` also includes a number of
features that make a functional style of programming easier, such as a
full range of boolean functions (e.g `ge`, `gt`, etc) which give the
same answer as the functions from Python’s `operator` module if given
two parameters, but return a [curried
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) if given one
parameter.

There’s too much functionality to show it all here, so be sure to check
the docs. Many little things are added that we thought should have been
in `list` in the first place, such as making this do what you’d expect
(which is an error with `list`, but works fine with
[`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l)):

``` python
1 + L(2,3,4)
```

    (#4) [1,2,3,4]

### Transforms

A [`Transform`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/transform.html#transform) is
the main building block of the fastai data pipelines. In the most
general terms a transform can be any function you want to apply to your
data, however the
[`Transform`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/transform.html#transform) class
provides several mechanisms that make the process of building them easy
and flexible (see the docs for information about each of these):

- Type dispatch
- Dispatch over tuples
- Reversability
- Type propagation
- Preprocessing
- Filtering based on the dataset type
- Ordering
- Appending new behavior with decorators

[`Transform`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/transform.html#transform) looks
for three special methods, <code>encodes</code>, <code>decodes</code>,
and <code>setups</code>, which provide the implementation for
[`__call__`](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_magic_methods.php),
`decode`, and `setup` respectively. For instance:

``` python
class A(Transform):
    def encodes(self, x): return x+1

A()(1)
```

    2

For simple transforms like this, you can also use
[`Transform`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/transform.html#transform) as a
decorator:

``` python
@Transform
def f(x): return x+1

f(1)
```

    2

Transforms can be composed into a
[`Pipeline`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/transform.html#pipeline):

``` python
@Transform
def g(x): return x/2

pipe = Pipeline([f,g])
pipe(3)
```

    2.0

The power of
[`Transform`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/transform.html#transform) and
[`Pipeline`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/transform.html#pipeline) is best
understood by seeing how they’re used to create a complete data
processing pipeline. This is explained in [chapter
11](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/11_midlevel_data.ipynb)
of the [fastai
book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527),
which is [available for free](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) in
Jupyter Notebook format.
