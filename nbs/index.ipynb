    "This approach to dispatch is particularly useful for adding implementations of functionality in extension modules or user code. It is heavily used in the `Transform` class. A `Transform` is the main building block of the fastai data pipelines. In the most general terms a transform can be any function you want to apply to your data, however the `Transform` class provides several mechanisms that make the process of building them easy and flexible (see the docs for information about each of these):\n",
